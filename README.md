# Character-Recognition (OCR)

#### Optical character recognition or optical character reader abbreviated as OCR, is the conversion of images of handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example, a bill of products can be scanned and stored in the PC as a record).

*In this simple project, the text is scanned, boxed out and the message is detected.*

*It uses tesseract and East text detector deeplearning model.*
